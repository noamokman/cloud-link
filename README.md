#### Synonym
This module is exported as `cloud-link` and as `clink`.

### Getting started
First you need to indicate where your cloud folder is.
```bash
cloud-link init ~/Google Drive
```

Then add links with the `add` command
```bash
cloud-link add hyper .hyper.js ~/.hyper.js
```
This will create a symlink between the file in your cloud folder and the given destination

See all links with
```bash
cloud-link list
```
